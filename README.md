# PRODIGY_CS_01
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm, which is used for encrypting and decrypting text messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number.

This is the first task for the Cyber Security Intern role, where we implement the Caesar Cipher as a basic form of encryption and decryption.

The Caesar Cipher algorithm is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the text by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. The code allows both encryption and decryption of messages using the cipher.

- Encryption: Encrypt a message by shifting each letter by a specified key.
- Decryption: Decrypt an encrypted message using the same key.
- Custom Shift: Supports custom shift values to make the cipher more flexible.
